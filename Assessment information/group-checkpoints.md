# Group checkpoints summary
*	Outputs/KPIs come in from outside clients and lecturer assigns them amongst the teams.
*	Team coordinators coordinate the tasks within their teams.
*	All team members have equal responsibility for quality completion of tasks.

Deliverables must meet the following minimum in order to be accepted:
  -	Spelling and grammar mistakes do not hamper flow for reader
  -	Tone and language are appropriate for audience
  -	Images are used to improve clarity in appropriate places
  -	Headings are used logically to improve clarity
  -	Formatting is simple, clear and suited to purpose
  -	Output produced meets all aspects of the specified purpose
  
Sub-standard tasks are handed back to the team to fix (and are thereby late).  
_It doesn’t matter if the team does not complete the task if it’s not their fault (e.g. the client pulls out; or the task suffers scope creep outside of the control of the team)._

## How to deliver deliverables
The following are guidelines on how to hand in your team project work using GitHub:
* Do all work on a branch other than the master branch
* Do all work on people's individual clones of the main team repo
* Keep things very tidy all the time
* Hand in by merging to the master branch when the team feels the work is deliverable
* Keep each project in its own project folder inside of your team repo
* Keep each final deliverable at the top level of the project folder when handing in
* Include a working files folder within your project folder
* Always hand in all working files (e.g. psd or ai files)
* Did I mention to keep everything really tidy?
