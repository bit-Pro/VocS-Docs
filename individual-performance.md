### Objectives:
1.	Demonstrate communications skills appropriate to the IT industry
2.	Produce quality IT-related writing which contributes to group goals
3.	Analyse personal performance and take actions to improve that performance

### Background:
Performance is what you are measured on in the work force. Unlike in education, where performance is measured by sitting tests and doing assessments, in the work force you must produce your own evidence that you are performing. Part of this is about giving the impression that you are contributing well to the organisation, and part is measurable things that you do.

## Instructions
-	This assessment begins during the job application process where you will introduce your communication and writing skills, both by demonstrating and describing (reflecting on) their current level.
-	From that point onwards you will set concrete goals to improve your performance, skills and knowledge.
-	You will be asked to reflect upon your progress towards these goals in performance meetings.

Reflect upon and describe your performance and ability at the beginning of the course via your job application. 
Maintain and achieve your performance and development goals throughout the course.
Reflect upon your own performance and upon feedback from others.
